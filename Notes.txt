- Claude output beautiful dataset summaries to help get me started exploring the data
- Created MetaM and Desights profiles
    - Desights profile had GraphQL 502 error, DMed mod for help
- Next steps
    - Go step by step through Claudes recommendations for exloring the datasets
    - Begin "In-depth Analysis: Detail your analysis of each question, ensuring that the explanations of your findings are clear, 
      compelling, and non-technical. Use analogies or simple comparisons where possible to elucidate your points."
        - This is basically completing the "Evaluation Critera" section by section, bullet by bullet
        - Once I have completed all of the bullet points and sections, I can go back and write the report.
